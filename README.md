# python-challenge
PyBank Script
#1 Import
Standard step we did in python homework

#2 Filepath
I had to watch a youtube video which showed me how to copy the filepath for the budget_data csv file directly from VScode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b678IZ1O1pM
I also asked chatGPT why I received a SyntaxError: (unicode error) and it recommended using the prefix 'r' to use a raw string literal, when I attempted to do os.path.join it kept giving me errors while this way worked and the code ran. Google says its a windows issue??

#3 Variables 
This was covered in 3.1 activites, specifically 03-Ins_Variables

#4 Read in the CSV File
this was covered in 3.2 activites, specifically 09-Stu_ReadComicBooksCSV, 08-Ins_ReadCSV

#5 Calculate average change
I found various examples of this in stack overflow which said to round the sum(average) to 2 decible places round(sum((x/x), 2) 

#6 Find the greatest increase and decrease in profits


#7 Print results to the terminal
We've learned to print in various homework assignments and 3.1 03-Ins_Variables activity was useful
