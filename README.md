# python-challenge
PyBank Script

#1 Import
Standard step we did in python homework

#2 Filepath
I had to watch a youtube video which showed me how to copy the filepath for the budget_data csv file directly from VScode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b678IZ1O1pM
I also asked chatGPT why I received a SyntaxError: (unicode error) and it recommended using the prefix 'r' to use a raw string literal, when I attempted to do os.path.join it kept giving me errors while this way worked and the code ran. Google says its a windows issue??

#3 Variables 
This was covered in 3.1 activites, specifically 03-Ins_Variables

#4 Read in the CSV File
this was covered in 3.2 activites, specifically 09-Stu_ReadComicBooksCSV, 08-Ins_ReadCSV

#5 Calculate average change
I found various examples of this in stack overflow which said to round the sum(average) to 2 decible places round(sum((x/x), 2) 

#6 Find the greatest increase and decrease in profits
We learned to use Max and Min in class, this was straitforward

#7 Print results to the terminal
We've learned to print in various homework assignments and 3.1 03-Ins_Variables activity was useful 

#8 Export results to a text file in "analysis" folder in PyBank
This was covered in 3.2 activites 10-Ins_WriteCSV homework

#6 Calculate each candidate's percentage of votes and total number of votes won  
Alot of this was in 3.3 08-Evr_GradingFunctions homework. ChatGPT revised some of my calculations that simply were not working and guided me with the final example that ran without errors, specifically the .items on line 38 and the % after {percentage} to match the text prompt outlined in module 3 instructions
